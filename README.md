6. Click through the informational windows and verify that the new extention is in the list.
7. Drop the module onto your website page.

## My Process

Getting my environment set up was my first step and also probably what took the most time. Having never touched DotNetNuke before, I searched for how to install and came across a tutorial that I followed but I found out later it skipped some pretty important steps. I went back and took the time to watch the videos included above - as well as about 4 or 5 other videos in that series as well. I found some good resources when it came down to actually creating the module and was able to get most of it working pretty quickly. I did stumble a bit when it came to the parameters for the facebook SDK, but was able to get all but the user_hometown working. All in all, I learned a lot and had fun with this challenge!
